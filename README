Introduction
============

This is a spectrum sensing application for the VESNA platform. It presents
a unified interface to different radiofrequency energy detection modules
through a serial terminal. It also serves as an example use of hardware
drivers using the low-level spectrum sensing API.

All spectrum sensing devices supported by this application work by tuning
to a radiofrequency channel and estimating the power level at the antenna
interface. The range of frequencies that can be sensed is determined by a
hardware configuration. Each device may support one or more configurations.
A configuration is characterized by the frequency of the bottom-most
channel, channel spacing, channel bandwidth, number of channels and the
time it takes the device to perform a measurement for a single channel.

Currently the following hardware models are supported (selectable via the
MODEL environment variable when invoking make):

- sne-crewtv

  VESNA SNC + SNE-CREWTV hardware configuration

  wide-band energy detection in the UHF band using NXP TDA18219HN tuner
  (also requires proprietary libtda18219 VESNA library)

- sne-ismtv-uhf

  VESNA SNC + SNE-ISMTV-UHF hardware configuration

  wide-band energy detection in the UHF band using NXP TDA18219HN tuner
  (also requires proprietary libtda18219 VESNA library)

- sne-ismtv-868

  VESNA SNC + SNE-ISMTV-868 hardware configuration

  energy detection in the 868 MHz ISM band using Texas Instruments
  CC1101.

- snr-trx-868

  VESNA SNC + SNR-TRX-868 hardware configuration

  energy detection in the 868 MHz ISM band using Texas Instruments
  CC1101.

- sne-ismtv-2400

  VESNA SNC + SNE-ISMTV-2400 hardware configuration

  energy detection in the 2.4 GHz ISM band using Texas Instruments
  CC2500.

- snr-trx-2400

  VESNA SNC + SNR-TRX-2400 hardware configuration

  energy detection in the 2.4 GHz ISM band using Texas Instruments
  CC2500.

- null

  VESNA SNC hardware configuration

  dummy software-only device, returning noise and zero measurements

Compilation
===========

To compile and upload firmware to a VESNA using OpenOCD and Olimex
ARM-USB-OCD:

$ make MODEL=sne-crewtv spectrum-sensor.u

Set the MODEL variable to the name of the hardware model you are
using.


Usage
=====

Connect VESNA to a serial terminal using 115200 baud, 8 data bits, 1 stop
bit, no parity. 

You can then use the terminal to interact with the application in a
command-line fashion (conclude each command with a new line)

Type "help" to print a list of available commands with brief descriptions.

A typical session consists of:

1. "list" command to get the list of hardware configurations available

2. "select" command to select a configuration and setup the spectrum sweep
   parameters.

3. "report-on" command to start the sweep.

4. "report-off" command to stop the sweep.
