Introduction
============

This Python module abstracts the serial line protocol used by the VESNA
spectrum sensor application and provides a high-level object-oriented
Python interface.


Installation
============

To install system-wide, run:

$ python setup.py install

To run provided unit tests, run:

$ python setup.py test


Usage
=====

The minimal application using this module looks like the following:

	# instantiate the SpectrumSensor class using the path
	# to the serial device.
	spectrumsensor = SpectrumSensor("/dev/ttyUSB0")

	# query the attached hardware for supported configurations.
	config_list = spectrumsensor.get_config_list()

	# get required frequency sweep configuration.
	sweep_config = config_list.get_sweep_config(...)

	# define callback function that does something with
	# measurements.
	def callback(sweep_config, sweep):
		...

	# start spectrum sensing
	spectrumsensor.run(sweep_config, callback)

Please refer to docstring documentation for details.

Installation also includes a rftest.py script that performs a series of
automated hardware tests using a USBTMC attached RF signal generator.
Run "rftest.py --help" to get a list of available options.
